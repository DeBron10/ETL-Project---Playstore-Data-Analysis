# Databricks & PySpark Data Processing

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to leverage **Databricks** and **PySpark** for large-scale data processing and analysis. The primary focus is on ingesting data from **Azure Blob Storage**, performing data cleaning and transformations using PySpark, and finally storing the processed data in an **Azure SQL Database**. This workflow is essential for handling big data tasks in a cloud-based environment, enabling efficient data management, processing, and storage.

## Project Statement

The goal of this project is to build a scalable data processing pipeline that can:
1. Ingest raw data from Azure Blob Storage.
2. Transform and clean the data using PySpark within an Azure Databricks environment.
3. Store the cleaned and processed data into Azure SQL Database for further querying and analysis.

This pipeline can be adapted and extended for various big data projects, where seamless integration between data storage, processing, and databases is required.

## Tools Used

- **Azure Databricks**: A cloud-based platform for big data analytics and machine learning that allows users to run large-scale Spark jobs. It is used here to create a scalable environment for data processing using PySpark.
  
- **PySpark**: The Python API for Apache Spark, which provides powerful tools for data processing and machine learning. It is used for data transformations, including cleaning, filtering, and schema modifications.

- **Azure Blob Storage**: A service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data. In this project, it serves as the source for the raw data.

- **Azure SQL Database**: A managed cloud database service by Microsoft Azure. The processed data is stored here, making it available for structured queries and further analysis.

## What Has Been Done

1. **Library Installation and Setup**: The necessary libraries, including `azure-storage-blob`, were installed and set up within the Databricks environment.

2. **Data Ingestion**: Data was read from Azure Blob Storage into a Spark DataFrame. This step involved connecting to Azure Blob Storage using the `BlobServiceClient` and reading the data directly into PySpark.

3. **Data Processing and Cleaning**:
   - Unnecessary columns were dropped to streamline the dataset.
   - The schema of the data was modified to fit the requirements of Azure SQL Database.
   - A specific transformation was applied to ensure data consistency.

4. **SQL Integration**: The cleaned and transformed data was written into an Azure SQL Database using PySpark's write operation, enabling efficient storage and future querying.

5. **SQL Queries**: The project includes SQL queries executed within the Databricks environment to validate the data processing and transformation.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end process of data ingestion, transformation, and storage using Azure Databricks and PySpark. By integrating these powerful tools, we can efficiently handle large datasets and prepare them for structured analysis in Azure SQL Database. This setup provides a robust framework for big data processing tasks in cloud environments, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and efficiency.
